Write a C program for creating a multi-threaded process and check:


	A.	If one thread in the process calls fork(), does the new process duplicate all threads,
		or is the new process single-threaded?

	B. 	If a thread invokes the exec() system call, does it replace the entire code of the process?

	C. 	If exec() is called immediately after forking, will all threads be duplicated?
